# Battlefield test

I had a task of creating a battlefield, where cowboys enter a pub and start shooting randomly at each other.

Requirements:
* List of fighters are given in a json format:
<code>{'name': 'John', 'health': 10, 'damage': 1}</code>
* All fighters shoot at the same time at a random target and then take time to reload a gun.
* Print to console battle events and the last man standing.
